# Handoff drift — known disagreements (Phase 1 baseline)

> Fixture for `handoff-drift.test.mjs`. Documents symbols that exist in
> one source but not the other, on `c117418` (origin/main HEAD when this
> baseline was pinned). The Phase 1 drift test asserts agreement on the
> _intersection_ of symbols across `--help` and `skills/handoff/SKILL.md`;
> everything below is intentionally outside the asserted intersection
> until the named Phase 2 PR (per `docs/specs/handoff-skill/spec/6-implementation-plan.md` §6.3) resolves it.
>
> When a Phase 2 PR moves a symbol from "disagreement" to "agreement," it
> deletes the corresponding entry below and lets the test's intersection
> assertion grow. The last Phase 2 PR (PR 8) folds in `docs/handoff-guide.md`
> as a third source.
>
> **`docs/handoff-guide.md` is excluded entirely from Phase 1.** Per spec §1
> it is heavily drifted from both `--help` and `SKILL.md` (refs removed
> sub-commands `digest`/`file`/`describe`, says "five forms", uses `--cli`
> legacy alias). It joins as the third source in PR 8.

## Excluded flags

The Phase 1 test extracts a flat global flag set from each source and
asserts agreement on the intersection. Flags that appear in only one
source are excluded until reconciled.

## Internal — SKILL.md self-disagreement

Not an excluded symbol per se, but a third datapoint for §1's "patch-loop
tax" thesis: `SKILL.md` is internally inconsistent on `c117418`.

- `argument-hint` frontmatter (line 27): `pull|push|fetch|list|search|resolve|doctor` — omits `remote-list`.
- `Sub-commands` markdown table (lines 81-90): includes `remote-list`, omits `prune`.

The Phase 1 extractor pins on the `argument-hint` frontmatter line as the
authoritative SKILL.md command source — it is structured YAML, machine-
parseable, and matches the SKILL.md schema's contract. The Sub-commands
table is prose documentation that drifted from the frontmatter under the
patch-loop. Phase 2 PR 6 (SKILL.md shrink per §3 component table) is
where the two SKILL.md sub-symbol sources reconverge.
