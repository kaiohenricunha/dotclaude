  Transfer conversation context between agentic CLIs (Claude Code, GitHub
  Copilot CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI) locally and across machines. Reads a
  source session transcript by UUID and produces either an inline summary,
  a paste-ready handoff digest, a written markdown file, or a branch in a
  user-owned private git repo that another machine can pull. Use when
  switching agents mid-task, recovering context, or moving between
  Windows/Linux/macOS setups. Triggers on: "handoff", "transfer context",
  "continue in codex", "continue in claude", "continue in copilot",
  "switch to codex", "switch to claude", "what was that session about",
  "claude --resume", "copilot --resume", "codex resume",
  "find the session where", "search sessions", "which session did I",
  "push handoff", "pull handoff", "handoff to other machine",
  "resume on my other laptop".

# Handoff — Cross-CLI Session Context Transfer

This skill is a thin wrapper around the `dotclaude handoff` binary.
The binary is the executable contract; the skill exists to map natural
language ("continue this in codex") into the right invocation and to
document the public surface in one place. Every form below also works
verbatim as `!dotclaude handoff …` from any shell — including Codex's
bash tool.

## The four forms

```
/handoff <query>                          local cross-agent: emit <handoff>
/handoff push [<query>] [--tag <label>]   upload to transport
/handoff pull [<query>]                   fetch from transport
/handoff list [--local|--remote] [--from <cli>] [--since <ISO>] [--limit N|--all]
```

A bare `/handoff` with no arguments prints usage and exits 0. Every
remote verb is explicit.

`<query>` auto-detects across `~/.claude/projects`,
`~/.copilot/session-state`, and `~/.codex/sessions`. Accepted forms:
full UUID, short UUID (first 8 hex), `latest`, Claude `customTitle`
alias, Codex `thread_name` alias.

**`latest` is host-scoped.** When the binary identifies the invoking
CLI (via `--from` or host-specific env-var probes such as `CLAUDECODE=1`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`, `CODEX_*`, `COPILOT_*`, and `GITHUB_COPILOT_*`),
`latest` resolves within that CLI's root only — so inside Claude Code
it picks the newest `~/.claude/projects` session even when a newer
Codex JSONL exists on disk. Explicit UUIDs and aliases are never
narrowed. Without a host signal `latest` falls back to the union
resolver (globally newest across all roots) and stderr names the
picked session. Pass `--from <cli>` to force a specific root.

**Collision model.** When `<query>` matches multiple roots (or two
remote handoffs on `pull`): TTY → interactive prompt; non-TTY → exit 2
with a TSV candidate list on stderr.

## Sub-commands

The binary's `--help` lists the full surface and authoritative flag
semantics. Brief summary:

| Sub                   | Purpose                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resolve <cli> <id>`  | Print the absolute JSONL path                                                               |
| `describe <cli> <id>` | Inline 2–4 sentence summary + verbatim user prompts                                         |
| `digest <cli> <id>`   | Print a paste-ready `<handoff>` block (no transport)                                        |
| `file <cli> <id>`     | Write the digest to `docs/handoffs/<date>-<cli>-<short>.md`                                 |
| `list`                | Unified local + remote table (`--local`/`--remote`, `--from`, `--since`, `--limit`/`--all`) |
| `search <query>`      | Substring/regex match across local sessions; `--from` / `--since` / `--fixed` / `--json`    |
| `push [<query>]`      | Push to `$DOTCLAUDE_HANDOFF_REPO`; `--tag` / `--include-transcript`                         |
| `pull [<handle>]`     | Fetch from `$DOTCLAUDE_HANDOFF_REPO`; `--from-file` for offline                             |
| `remote-list`         | List handoffs on the transport; `--cli` / `--since` / `--limit`                             |
| `doctor`              | Verify `git` + `$DOTCLAUDE_HANDOFF_REPO` + `gh` fallback                                    |

Cross-cutting flags (consult `--help` for the canonical list):

- `--from <cli>` narrows source-CLI auto-detection on `push`, `pull`,
  bare `<query>`, and filters `list`, `search`, and `remote-list` to
  one root. Without it, the resolver probes all three roots. `--cli`
  is accepted as a legacy alias on `search` and `remote-list`.
- `--to <cli>` tunes the `<handoff>` block's next-step wording for a
  target agent. Defaults to the auto-detected host.
- `--since <ISO>` cuts off `list` when explicitly provided, and
  cuts off `search` and `remote-list` (default 30 days).
- `--limit <N>` caps the row count (default 20). `--all` (on `list`)
  disables the cap.
- `--fixed` / `-F` treats the `search` query as a literal string
  instead of a regex.
- `--tag <label>` annotates a `push` for fuzzy `pull` later.
- `--include-transcript` adds the last 50 raw turns to a `push`
  (off by default to minimise leakage).
- `--from-file <path>` lets `pull` load a local markdown file written
  by `file`. Works without network access.
- `--json` is honoured by `list`, `describe`, `remote-list`, `search`.

## Prerequisites

Local sub-commands need only `jq` and the session files on disk.

The remote transport (`push`/`pull`/`remote-list`/`doctor`) is a
user-owned private git repo (any provider — GitHub, GitLab, Gitea,
self-hosted). Required:

- `git` on PATH.
- Either `$DOTCLAUDE_HANDOFF_REPO` set to a repo URL, **or** the binary
  will auto-bootstrap on first `push` when stdin is a TTY and `gh` is
  authenticated — it offers to `gh repo create` a private store and
  persists the URL to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dotclaude/handoff.env` (default:
  `~/.config/dotclaude/handoff.env`) for future runs.
- Working SSH or credential-helper auth for the resulting repo.

That's it. No `init` step, no schema pin, no ceremony. Run
`dotclaude handoff doctor` for a sanity check; see
`references/prerequisites.md` for the full install matrix.

## Repo layout

Each handoff is a branch:

```
handoff/<project>/<cli>/<YYYY-MM>/<short-uuid>
```

e.g. `handoff/dotclaude/claude/2026-04/aaaa1111`. The store needs no
setup beyond "be a reachable git repo"; `main` is never touched by
`push` / `pull` / `remote-list`. GitHub UI + `git ls-remote` render
the branches directly.

## Auto-trigger contract

When the user message matches any of these patterns, run the bare
`<query>` form (local cross-agent digest) by default:

- Resume-command fragments: `claude --resume <uuid>`,
  `claude --resume "<name>"`, `copilot --resume=<uuid>`,
  `codex resume <uuid>`, `codex resume <name>`.
- Natural language: "what was that session about", "continue in X",
  "switch to X", "handoff".

Extract the `<query>` from the user message (UUID, short UUID, or
named alias). The skill probes all three roots — no `<cli>` argument
needed. If the query is missing or ambiguous, ask one clarifying
question before proceeding.

## Out of scope

- **Invoking the target CLI directly.** The skill prints; the user
  pastes. This is deliberate — keeps the transfer auditable and
  prevents unintended cross-session execution.
- **End-to-end encryption.** The git transport is access-controlled
  by the host (private repo + push-side auth), but content is stored
  in plaintext on the remote. Every `push` runs the scrubber before
  uploading and reports `[scrubbed N secrets]` as the final stdout
  line; the push fails closed (exit 2, no commit written) if the
  scrubber cannot run. Scrubbing is a best-effort pattern pass (see
  `references/redaction.md`) — do not rely on it to catch bespoke
  or obfuscated secrets.
- **Fuzzy or semantic search.** `search` is substring/regex only.
- **Persistent indexing.** Grep-at-query-time is fast enough for
  local session volumes; revisit only if p95 exceeds ~2s.
