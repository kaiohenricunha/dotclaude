# Spec-Driven Design

Create structured engineering specifications through interactive, phased collaboration.
Outputs organized markdown files into `docs/specs/<spec-name>/` of the current project.

## Arguments

- `$0` — spec name (kebab-case). If not provided, ask the user.
- `$1` — brief description of what the spec covers (free text, optional). Used to seed the README subtitle and give context for Phase 2 questions. If not provided, proceed normally — the user will supply context interactively.
- `--brownfield` flag — if present, include a `current-state/` folder for existing system analysis.

## Workflow Overview

There are 3 phases. **Always start with Phase 1.** Do not skip ahead.

---

### Phase 1: Scaffold

Create the spec directory and empty section files. This gives the user a concrete structure to react to.

**Steps:**

1. Determine the spec name from `$0` or ask the user. Capture the description from `$1` if provided.
2. Create the directory structure:

```
docs/specs/<spec-name>/
├── README.md
├── spec/
│   ├── 1-problem-motivation.md
│   ├── 2-scope.md
│   ├── 3-high-level-architecture.md
│   ├── 4-data-flow-components.md
│   ├── 5-interfaces-apis.md
│   ├── 6-implementation-plan.md
│   ├── 7-non-functional-requirements.md
│   └── 8-risks-alternatives.md
├── research/
│   └── sources.md
└── current-state/              ← only if --brownfield
    └── analysis.md
```

3. Each spec section file gets the scaffold template (see "Section Scaffolds" below).
4. The README gets a status dashboard showing all sections as `[ ] empty`.
5. Tell the user the scaffold is created.
   - **If `$1` was provided:** "Scaffold created. Based on your description — _{$1}_ — let's start with §1 Problem/Motivation. What specifically is broken or missing that this addresses?"
   - **If no description:** "Scaffold created. Let's fill it in — starting with §1 Problem/Motivation. What problem are we solving?"

**Do not fill in any content during scaffolding.** The scaffold is purely structural (the description goes only in the README header, not into section bodies).

---

### Phase 2: Interactive Fill-In

Walk through each section with the user. For each section:

1. **Ask** a focused question about what belongs in that section.
2. **Listen** — only write what the user provides or explicitly approves. Never invent requirements.
3. **Write** — update the section file with the user's input, properly formatted.
4. **Tag** — assign constraint IDs where appropriate (ARCH-1, PERF-1, etc.) for cross-referencing.
5. **Update README** — mark the section status as `[~] in-progress` or `[x] done`.
6. **Offer next** — suggest moving to the next section, or ask if they want to go deeper.

**Section order is suggested, not mandatory.** If the user wants to jump to §6 Implementation Plan, go there. If they want to revisit §2 Scope after filling §5, do that.

**Rules:**

- Only add content the user explicitly provides or approves.
- Tag constraints with IDs (e.g., PERF-1, SEC-3, ARCH-1) for cross-referencing between sections.
- Place constraints in the section they **shape**, not just where they're mentioned.
- Cross-reference between sections: "See ARCH-1 in §3" or "Feeds into §6 Phase 2".
- Empty sections are fine — mark them and move on. The user fills them when ready.

#### Research Sources

As the user references documents, codebases, or external resources:

1. Assign each a **DOC-N** identifier.
2. Add it to `research/sources.md` with a one-line description.
3. Tag which spec sections it feeds (e.g., "Feeds: §3, §5, §7").

#### Deep Dives

For complex sections (especially §4 Data Flow and §6 Implementation Plan), offer to generate
**analysis prompts** the user can run in separate Claude Code sessions. Use the templates
from [references/cc-prompt-templates.md](references/cc-prompt-templates.md).

When the user pastes back results, integrate findings into the appropriate section files.

---

### Phase 3: Finalize

When all sections are filled (or the user says "done" / "finalize"):

1. Do a consistency pass — check cross-references are valid, constraint IDs are used, no orphaned references.
2. Update README with final status: all sections marked `[x] done` or `[ ] skipped`.
3. Add a "Quick Start" section to README pointing to the most important sections.
4. Tell the user the spec is complete and where to find it.

## Key Principles

1. **User drives content, Claude drives structure.** Never invent requirements. Place user input in the correct section with proper tagging.
2. **Scaffold first, fill interactively.** Create the empty structure immediately so the user can see what they're building toward.
3. **Cross-reference everything.** Constraints reference sections. Docs reference sections. Prompts reference docs and files.
4. **TDD-first in §6.** Every prompt in the Implementation Plan must list failing test names before implementation instructions.
5. **Empty sections are fine.** Don't fill sections preemptively. Mark them empty and move on.
6. **Constraints belong where they shape design.** A testing requirement goes in §6, not §7. A modularity requirement goes in §4, not §7. Operational limits go in §7.
7. **One question at a time.** Don't overwhelm the user with multiple questions. Ask about one section or one aspect, then write what they give you.
