Fix a bug using a strict four-phase evidence loop: Reproduce → Fix → Verify → PR. Each phase gates on the previous.

Trigger: when the user asks for a bug fix, wants to address an issue, or says "fix X". Also triggered directly via `/fix-with-evidence <issue>`.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` — an issue number, link, or symptom description. If empty, ask the user.

## Phase 1 — Reproduce

1. Read the issue or symptom description. For a GitHub issue: `gh issue view <N>`.
2. Use `Grep` + `Read` to locate the code path involved. Cite `file:line` references.
3. Write a test that reproduces the bug. Add it to the appropriate test file.
4. Run the test. **Paste the actual failure output** in your response.

**Gate:** do not proceed to Phase 2 until you have a failing test with output captured. If the bug cannot be reproduced in a test, STOP and ask the user how they observed it.

## Phase 2 — Fix

1. Propose a minimal change. Avoid scope creep — touch only what is required to make the failing test pass.
2. Apply the edit.
3. Do not refactor surrounding code, rename variables, or "clean up" unrelated issues in the same commit.

**Gate:** if the fix requires touching more than ~3 files or reveals a misunderstanding of the issue, STOP and re-scope with the user. Do not patch forward.

## Phase 3 — Verify

1. Run the **full** project test suite (not just the new test). Detect runner from `Makefile` / `package.json` / `go.mod` / `pyproject.toml`.
2. For any failure other than your new test (which should now pass), prove whether it is pre-existing:
   ```bash
   git stash
   <test-command>
   git stash pop
   ```
   If the failure survives the stash, it is pre-existing — record that. If it disappears, your fix introduced a regression — return to Phase 2.
3. Record before/after test counts: `N passed, M failed` on `main` vs on the branch.

**Gate:** do not proceed to Phase 4 until the full suite is green on the branch OR every non-green test is proven pre-existing with stash output.

## Phase 4 — PR

1. Write the PR body to a temporary file (not heredoc, to avoid backtick escaping):

   ```
   ## Summary
   <1–3 bullets>

   ## Reproduction
   <how the bug was observed; include the failing test added in Phase 1>

   ## Root Cause
   <what was actually wrong; cite file:line>

   ## Fix
   <what changed and why; cite file:line>

   ## Test Evidence
   Before: <passed>/<failed> on main
   After:  <passed>/<failed> on branch
   <paste tail of test output>

   ## Risk
   <what could break; what you did not touch>

   Spec ID: <id if applicable>
   ```

2. Open the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
   ```
3. Report the PR URL to the user. Do not merge — that is a separate decision (use `/merge-pr`).

## Rules

- Never skip Phase 1. A fix without a reproducing test is a guess.
- Never claim a failure is "pre-existing" without the `git stash` proof.
- Never expand scope mid-fix. If you find a second bug, note it and create a separate issue — do not bundle.
- Never heredoc PR bodies — always `--body-file`.
- If any phase reveals the original issue was misunderstood, STOP, re-scope, and restart from Phase 1 on the corrected understanding.
